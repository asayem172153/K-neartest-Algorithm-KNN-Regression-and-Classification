# KNN / K-Nearest Algorithm 
1. [KNN Regression](https://github.com/asayem172153/K-neartest-Algorithm-KNN-Regression-and-Classification/blob/4321e77944ce50370cb89e687ac7f7c45e6597d0/KNN_regression.ipynb): Here I have implemented the concept of KNN Regression Menually. Using three array **(Age, Height, Weight)** and assume they are connected. we predicted a weight for Age = 38 and Height = 5.5  
2. [Project 2](https://github.com/asayem172153/K-neartest-Algorithm-KNN-Regression-and-Classification/blob/4321e77944ce50370cb89e687ac7f7c45e6597d0/knn-regression-classification.ipynb) Here various of comparison and things have done-
   - Applied Linear Regression(LR).
     - Evaluate Testing and training Score
     - Evaluate MSE for test cases
   - Applied [KNN Regressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html)
     - Evaluate Testing and training Score
     - Evaluate MSE for test cases
   - Compare Linear Regression model with KNN regressor model
   - Applied [KNN Classifier] (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)
     - Evaluate Accuracy only
